Cow's Milk - Introduction

In some places, like the United States, drinking cow’s milk is common.
Imagine that three students, Anna, Christopher and Sam, are at a coffee shop in the United States. The owner recently placed a sign in the window that stated: “After April 5th we will no longer serve cow’s milk here. Instead, we will offer a milk substitute made from soy.”
Anna, Christopher and Sam are curious about why the coffee shop would stop serving cow’s milk, so Anna does an Internet search on her smartphone for “cow’s milk”. They look at the first result and discuss it.
