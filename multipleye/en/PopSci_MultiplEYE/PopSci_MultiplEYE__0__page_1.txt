The MultiplEYE Project

The name "MultiplEYE" is a wordplay combining "multilingualism" or "multiple languages" with "eye" from "eye-tracking". MultiplEYE is a COST Action funded by the European Union. COST Actions are research networks supported by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology or COST for short. As a funding organisation, COST supports our growing network of researchers across Europe and beyond by providing financial assistance for conducting different networking activities.
