The North Wind and the Sun

The North Wind and the Sun were arguing about which one of them was stronger, when a traveler came by wearing a heavy coat. They agreed that whoever got the traveler to take off his coat first would be considered stronger. The North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the harder he blew, the tighter the traveler wrapped his coat around him, and finally the North Wind had to give up. Then the sun began to shine, and the traveler immediately took off his coat. And so the North Wind had to admit that the Sun was stronger.
