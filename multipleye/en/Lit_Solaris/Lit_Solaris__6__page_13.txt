Certainly, no other factor could be found that might explain the behavior of Solaris; moreover, the planetophysicists had established a relationship between certain processes of the plasmic ocean and the local measurements of gravitational pull, which altered according to the ‘matter transformations’ of the ocean. Consequently it was the physicists, rather than the biologists, who put forward the paradoxical formulation of a ‘plasmic mechanism,’ implying by this a structure, possibly without life as we conceive it, but capable of performing functional activities — on an astronomic scale, it should be emphasized.
