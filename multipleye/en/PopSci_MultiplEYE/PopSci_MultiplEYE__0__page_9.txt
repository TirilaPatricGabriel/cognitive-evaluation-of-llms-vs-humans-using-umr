But once completed, this dataset will allow us to investigate many topics related to psycholinguistics and computational linguistics. For example, we can compare the reading behaviour across different languages. Does the scripture, for example, the Latin alphabet versus Cyrillic or Arabic scripts, impact reading times? An example concerning the computational processing of text could involve using eye-tracking data to advance artificial intelligence applications that imitate the human reading process. This could be used to build better machine translation systems or to improve the automatic extraction of keywords from the text.
