One of the most recent and most important studies on the effects of drinking milk was published in the October 2014 issue of the British Medical Journal. The findings in this study led to some powerful assertions about the consumption of milk. In this study over 100 000 people in Sweden were followed over periods of 20-30 years. Researchers found that the female milk drinkers suffered more bone fractures. Additionally, both male and female milk drinkers were more likely to suffer from heart disease and cancer. These staggering results are similar to findings from other studies.
