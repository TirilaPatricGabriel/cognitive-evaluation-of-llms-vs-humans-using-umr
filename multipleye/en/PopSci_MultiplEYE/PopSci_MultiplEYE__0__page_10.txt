Receiving eye-tracking data from many participants, including yourself, by reading texts in many different languages will be a great foundation for our research. It will be the main factor in turning our research network into a successful endeavour. We hope to clear the way for advancing research in various subfields of linguistics by supporting and connecting a large group of researchers.
