The 2011 Council conclusions on a benchmark for learning mobility (2011/C372/08) invite the Commission to: 'report back to the Council by the end of 2015, with a view to reviewing and, if necessary, revising the European benchmark on learning mobility.'
The Council conclusions also request the Commission and the Member States to carry out a number of other actions, in particular in regard to indicators on student, youth and teacher mobility. However, there is no obligation to report back to the Council linked to these actions. They are described in more detail in separate available Commission documentation.
