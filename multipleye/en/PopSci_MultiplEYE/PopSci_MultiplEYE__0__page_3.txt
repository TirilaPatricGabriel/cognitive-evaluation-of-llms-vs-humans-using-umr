The goal is to support the development of a large multilingual eye-tracking corpus and enable researchers to collect data by sharing their knowledge between various fields, including linguistics, psychology, speech and language pathology, and computer science. This data collection can then be used to study human language processing from a psycholinguistic perspective as well as to improve and evaluate computational language processing from a machine-learning perspective.
