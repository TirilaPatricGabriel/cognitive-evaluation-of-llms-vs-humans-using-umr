Anna, Christopher and Sam are talking about the decision of the coffee shop owner to stop selling cow’s milk. Sam says, “Maybe cow’s milk is becoming too expensive.” Christopher is looking at his smartphone. “Maybe, but I did a web search on cow’s milk too. I’m going to text you the link to a more recent article that may explain it.”
Anna and Sam open the link Christopher sent and read the article, “Just Say ‘No’ to Cow’s Milk!”
