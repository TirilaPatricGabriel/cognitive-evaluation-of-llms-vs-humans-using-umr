The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) commented on some of the health problems related to the consumption of milk. It claims that milk and dairy products “have little or no benefit for bones.” The PCRM goes further to describe some specific problems associated with milk: “Milk proteins, milk sugar, fat, and saturated fat in dairy products pose health risks for children and encourage the development of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.”
