The motivation behind MultiplEYE is that eye-tracking data is still sparse, especially for languages with fewer speakers. Such extensive data collection is a challenge in terms of developing and agreeing on the experimental design, the complexity, and the types of texts to be read by the participants. Other decisions that seem less relevant but are, in fact, very important include the font type and size the text is presented in, the order of the texts, the experiment procedure, and how the data will be processed.
