As your brain is processing the content of the text, your eye movements reflect a lot of the linguistic and cognitive processing going on almost in real time. Thus, the recorded data is a gold mine of information about how we put together a text's meaning and grammatical structures. It shows which parts of the text we struggle with and which parts are easily readable. It is up to the researchers to later explain which linguistic factors caused which type of eye movements.
