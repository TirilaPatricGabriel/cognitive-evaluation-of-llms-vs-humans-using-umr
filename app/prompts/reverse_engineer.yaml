  You are analyzing a text to create a generation blueprint. Extract ALL details and structure so another LLM can recreate a semantically identical text.

  ## ORIGINAL TEXT:
  {text}

  ## TARGET METRICS:
  - Words: {word_count} (±10% max)
  - Sentences: {sentence_count} (±2 max)
  - Avg sentence: {avg_len} words
  - Expected UMR complexity: ~{word_count} concepts (approximately 1 concept per word)

  ## YOUR TASK:

  Create a generation prompt with these sections:

  ### 1. CONTENT CHECKLIST (List EVERY item that must appear):
  - **People:** [Name all people with exact titles]
  - **Organizations:** [Name all organizations with acronyms]

  ### 2. DISCOURSE STRUCTURE (Divide text into 5-7 sections):
  For each section:
  - Section X: [Type] (~[word count] words, sentences [range])
  - Must include: [bullet list of specific content]
  - Function: [one sentence purpose]

  ### 3. GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

  Output exactly this template:

  ---
  Write {word_count}-word Romanian text with {sentence_count} sentences.

  **CONTENT CHECKLIST** (all items mandatory):
  [Paste your checklist from section 1]

  **STRUCTURE** (follow this order):
  [Paste your sections from section 2]

  **RULES:**
  - Match word count: {word_count} ±10% (strict limit)
  - Match sentence count: {sentence_count} ±2 sentences
  - Follow section order exactly
  - Use simple, direct sentences matching source style
  - No elaboration beyond requirements - preserve source vocabulary
  - Include all checklist items exactly as given
  - Target similar UMR complexity (~{word_count} concepts)
