Four years after this promotion, overflying the planet with the Laakon and two auxiliary craft, the Ottenskjold expedition undertook a study of Solaris. This expedition being in the nature of a preliminary, not to say improvised reconnaissance, the scientists were not equipped for a landing. Ottenskjold placed a quantity of automatic observation satellites into equatorial and polar orbit, their principal function being to measure the gravitational pull.
