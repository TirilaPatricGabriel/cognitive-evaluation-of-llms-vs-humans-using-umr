What is "eye-tracking"?
Eye-tracking is the process of measuring the point of gaze - where you are looking - and the movements of the eyes between fixed points of gaze. The device used to measure the eye positions and eye movements is called an eye-tracker. It consists of an infrared camera, using a light frequency that does not bother or hurt the human eye.
